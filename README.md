# LAB - Class 10
## Project: Chocolate-Pizza

In lab today you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we’ve been doing this week. In fact, you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch.

You only have 4 hours to complete this assignment.

#### Instructions

It is your job to create a page that looks exactly like the preview below. Within your GitHub class repo, under today’s directory, you will find all of the assets required to accomplish this task in addition to a larger version of this preview image.
